We plan on making a simple racing game where the objective is to collect as many coins or something like that while avoiding  crashing in to obstacles that may appear on the road.

Our testing will be done in two phases. In phase one, we will test our code through unit testing. Once we have a working prototype we'll enter phase two. In phase two we'll play the game with the intent to break it, to discover bugs that might have slipped past the initial testing phase. Other people will also be playing the game trying to break it. When a bug is found the process well be repeated. 

How to install and play the game: Clone the repo and then run the Main.java file.
